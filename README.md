## Overview

Our Proof-Generation Mobile App offers a unique and innovative way to verify and share location-based information. This app is designed to provide users with a reliable method to prove their location, interact through localized chat rooms, and access a variety of services based on their geographical position.

### Key Features:

- **Location Proof Generation**: Generate and share proofs of your location using QR code scanning.
- **Visual History on Map**: View your past location proofs on an interactive map.
- **Localized Chat Rooms**: Join chat rooms based on your location for socializing and networking.
- **Versatile Applications**: Useful for event attendance verification, geographical restrictions, legal and security purposes, and ensuring emergency services integrity.

## How It Works

### Trusted Hardware and Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- The app relies on trusted hardware to obtain signed location data.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge (zk) circuits to verify the authenticity of location data without revealing sensitive information.

### Technical Components

- **Noir Language**: For developing zk circuits to verify location data.
- **NoirJS and Barretenberg Libraries**: For compiling and creating circuits on various platforms.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Using Solidity code for secure storage of proofs on EVM networks like Ethereum, Polygon, Mantle, and Scroll.
- **The Graph's Subgraph**: To efficiently query data for user feedback and app functionalities.
- **WalletConnect**: Integrated for quick user login.

### Chat Application and Conditional Access

- **Private Group Chat**: Utilizing Conditional Gateway technology for access based on location proofs.
- **Room Creation Editor**: Enables users to create chat rooms with geographical boundaries.
